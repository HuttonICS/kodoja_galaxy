# This is a tab-separated file listing any Kraken databases
# installed locally to offer via Galaxy.
#
# Expect three columns, tab separated, as follows:
# - Column 1 - value, the key which Galaxy will record in DB
# - Column 2 - name, the text caption which Galaxy show users
# - Column 3 - path, the directory name (which will contain
#   files named ``database.idx``, ``database.kdb`` and a
#   sub-directory named taxonomy containing files from the
#   NCBI named ``names.dmp`` and ``nodes.dmp``)
#
# e.g. using the database provided with the kraken-using tool
# kodoja at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1406071
#
# kodojaDB_v1.0_kraken(tab)KodojaDB v1.0 (kraken), Sept 2018(tab)/mnt/shared/data/kodojaDB_v1.0/krakenDB
#
# Furthermore, for backward compatibility with early versions of
# the Galaxy wrapper for Kraken, the Kodoja wrapper will also
# accept three columns as follows:
# - Column 1 - value, the key which Galaxy will record in DB
# - Column 2 - name, final part of folder name, which Galaxy
#   will show the user in the drop down lists to choose from
# - Column 3 - path, parent folder name where $value/$name
#   is the folder containing ``database.idx`` etc.
